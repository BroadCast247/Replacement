Trying to do software architecture because my programming fundamentals instructor recommended it.
However there are no fucking visual examples so I don't know what it should fucking look like.

REQUIREMENTS
- Twenty enemies spawned within the level and randomly selected from the three enemy categories.
- The first enemy category will react to the player by moving towards when in visible range and
attacking the player. When the player is not in visible range, it will stop attacking.
- The second enemy category performs turret style attacks when the player is in visible range. 
- For the third enemy category you will determine its functionality.
- Create four collectibles which can be used by the player, to obtain power-up abilities. At least one
item must be collected for the player to win the game.
- Create two particle systems which will launch when the player collects items or defeats enemies.
	Wtf is a particle system?
- Integrate music for your menu and sound effects for any in-game actions, such as attacking
enemies, collecting power-ups, etc.
- A level which must be created using the terrain editor, with the dimensions 500px x 500px x
600px (width, length and height respectively).
- A player which must be animated and controlled by a controller. It must also have the ability to
interactive with the level’s environment.
